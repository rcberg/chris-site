Executive summary
-----------------

Long-term climate forecasts project rises in both temperature and precipitation levels over the coming 50-100 years. Because temperature and precipitation are both important factors determining agricultural yields, these projections have important consequences for future agricultural productivity. To help better-understand those consequences, climate and agricultural data across the counties of America's "corn belt" (the states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana) are gathered and analyzed for insights into the effect of increasing temperature and rainfall. An overall finding is that both variables have a "hump shaped" relationship with crop yields; increasing summer temperature or precipitation from low levels improves yield. If temperatures are too high, or precipitation is excessive, it can be devastating for crop yields. Together, these trends suggest that unmitigated climate change may increasingly hurt agricultural productivity in the corn belt within the next 50-100 years.

Introduction
------------

Agriculture is one of the human endeavors most-sensitive to climate conditions, yet there's considerable uncertainty surrounding long-term climate forecasts. As it stands, the scientific consensus is that long-term climate conditions will be determined by the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and for agricultural purposes this will affect temperature and precipitation[^1]. Most decisions about farmland over the coming decades will require conducting expected cost-benefit calculations, which in turn require an assessment of the risks that long-term climate forecasts imply for land fertility and productivity. The materials contained in this report will hopefully support such assessments and calculations.

### Data information

Longer-term climate predictions cited here come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The data used in the analyses conducted here spans the recent 20-year history of America's "Corn Belt" (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) and combines publicly-available data on county-level weather (from the NOAA) as well as crop acreage and yields (from the USDA).

This means that each unit of observation (in other words, each "dot" on the scatterplots shown) is a specific county in a particular year, from across the corn belt (IL-IN-IA) over the years 2000-2020.

Temperatures
------------

Over the course of the 21st century, corn yields across the belt have exhibited a strong negative relationship with the maximum temperature observed in the month of July.

High July temperatures are indicative of drought conditions, and on the extreme end of $T \geq 90^{\circ}f$ these climate conditions are extremely destructive to corn fields, reducing yields to 50 -- 100 bushels/acre. In fact, maximum July temperatures around $T \approx 95^{\circ}f$ have *never* been observed in tandem with corn yields of 150 bushels/acre or more. The average observed corn yield when maximum July temperatures stay below 90 degrees is almost 167 bu./ac., but turning to the other side of 90 degrees, average observed corn yields are only about 110 bu./acre, a reduction of about a third. Looking at those most-extreme max. July temperatures greater than or equal to 95, average observed yields plummet to 71 bushels/acre.

Soybean yields similarly reduce with higher summer temperatures, but are much less-sensitive than corn. When looking at the hit that yields take during seasons of extreme temperatures, soybean yields in those extreme ($T \geq 95^{\circ}f$) seasons comes-in at 37 bushels/acre on average, compared to a "normal" ($T < 90^{\circ}f$) season of just under 50 bushels/acre.

Precipitation
-------------

Surface temperatures are not the only climate variable for agricultural planners to keep their eyes on going forward. The NOAA has observed large changes in patterns of heavy rainfall between the early 1900s and today. The corn belt has seen the most extreme of these changes thus far, and it is projected to be at the center of more-extreme changes in the future.

Corn yields exhibit a similar pattern with regards to to precipitation changes as they do to July temperatures. Like the high temperature in July, extremely high precipitation in the May-July months has roughly as much of a deleterious effect on yields as too-little precipitation. This fact has been observed in agronomic research[^2], as well. Forecasts of more extreme rains later in the 21st century could, then, represent a similar climate risk to land productivity as droughts.

Like before, we see a similar pattern for soybean yields as we do for corn. Soybeans, though, show a much smaller range of response. Having higher levels of growing season precipitation might degrade soybean yields but the effect appears much less-severe than it is when we look at corn yields, so unlike corn yields it's difficult to draw a conclusion about whether high precipitation poses a similar risk to soybean acres as droughts. In other words having more-extreme precipitation in the future is not good news for soybean crops, but it may still be better news than a drought, which we can't say for corn.

Productivity implications
-------------------------

Overall, the response patterns of crop yields to climate variation follow a "hump" shape; having more growing season precipitation or higher July temperatures helps, but only up to a point, and then they start to have a negative impact. Ultimately, then, the question we want answered is: How will climate change place us relative to these "sweet spots," where yields are maximized by the amount of sunshine vs. rain?

The IPCC reports suggest that parts of the corn belt would be in-line with or slightly exceeding the global average temperature increases that are projected. Their end-of-century forecasts clock-in around $+3^{\circ}c$ to $+4^{\circ}c$ from present levels, depending on the trajectory of GHG emissions. Relative to the current average maximum July temperatures of $85^{\circ}f$, this could produce average July highs in the range of $90^{\circ}f$ to $93^{\circ}f$ which based on recent history would suggest corn yields closer to 123.4 bu./acre, or about a 25\% reduction from current average yields.

It's possible that these adverse yields are either offset by forecasts of more-extreme precipitation, or potentiated by them. Previous agronomic research suggests that extreme precipitation can be as dangerous for yields as drought, and this appears to hold true in the case of corn yields. It's plausible that if the timing of the precipitation and extreme heat is fortuitous, the rains could ease drought impacts. Less-fortuitous timing could spell disastrous seasons where some planted acres see very low yields. 

A parting observation is that-- based on the IPCC forecasts as well as currently available data-- soybean acres may be substituted for corn in order to maintain a level of land productivity close to what we observe today.

{{< img src="/images/briefs/corn-acreage-share.png" width="60%" height="60%" alt="Share of planted corn in corn belt" align="center" >}}

We normally see slightly over half of total acres planted with corn (mostly ranging between just over a third to almost three-quarters of planted acres), if the goal is to come close to maintaining current productivity levels, we may see a shift in the histogram above. Presumably, corn would be planted at a lower rate if soybeans truly can better-handle the climate changes better. However, it's impossible to speculate much about what we'll see until we have a sense of how prices will respond to these changes. Knowing that there may be threats to land productivity, we need to model how commodity markets will respond in order to assess the impact on market participants like farmers or land owners. 

Reckoning these effects on prices in markets will be the subject of a future report.
